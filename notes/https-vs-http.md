# HTTP vs HTTPS

## 🔓 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Sends data in plain text.
- Vulnerable to interception, man-in-the-middle attacks.
- No encryption or identity verification.

## 🔐 HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
- Uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication.
- Protects data integrity and confidentiality.
- Verifies server identity via certificates.

## 🧠 Key Differences
| Feature        | HTTP           | HTTPS              |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Encryption     | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes (SSL/TLS)    |
| Security       | ❌ Low          | ✅ High             |
| Certificate    | ❌ Not required | ✅ Required         |
| Port           | 80             | 443                |

## 🌍 Why HTTPS Matters
- Builds trust with users.
